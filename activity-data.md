# Overview
Activity data is stored in the Learning Records Warehouse, which for the Jisc framework is based on [Learning Locker] (http://learninglocker.net/)

Each University or College has a single production locker. Developers may also request a development locker from Jisc. Universities or Colleges approve developer access to their locker, and credential for access will then be provided by Jisc. Access will be either to submit data, if the application provides data, or read data, if the application processes data.

## About xAPI

Data is stored in xAPI format.  Developments should therefore familiarise themselves with xAPI before proceeding, by reading the documentation on the Tincan web site [http://tincanapi.com/](http://tincanapi.com/).

Developers will then also need to understand the recipies used by Jisc. See:

[xAPI VLE Recipies](https://github.com/jiscdev/xapi-vle)

## Submitting Data

The process for submitting data is as follows:

1. Select and understand the appropriate xAPI client Library [https://tincanapi.com/libraries/](Client Libraries)
2. Determine with Recipies your application will use.
3. [Contact Jisc via email] (https://www.jisc.ac.uk/contact) to obtain access to a developer learning locker.  Provide an outline of you application and the recipies that you'll be using.
4. Submit your data using the xAPI client libraries.
5. Ask Jisc to approve your sample data.
6. Universities can then request Jisc provide you with access to their test or production Locker.
