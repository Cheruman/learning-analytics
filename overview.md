#Overview of the Framework

The core of the framework is the Learning Records Warehouse (LRW).  This hold data about student learning activity, as well as data about the student. Universites and colleges can provide access to developers and applications to submit data to the LRW, and to retrieve it.

### Activity Data
Activity data is stored in xAPI (or Tincan Format).  For information on Tincan see [http://tincanapi.com/](http://tincanapi.com/).

The framework defines a set of xAPI recipes for common activity data, and data submitted should conform to these recipies. Currently the following recipies are available.
